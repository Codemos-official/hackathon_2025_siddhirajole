Problem Statement

In the global export-import ecosystem, small and medium exporters face challenges in identifying high-demand products, understanding the required export documents, and evaluating country-specific risks before shipping. Currently, there is no single platform that provides all-in-one guidance including product demand analytics, documentation checklists, risk assessment, and export suggestions in a user-friendly, interactive way.

Exporters often waste time, miss regulatory requirements, or face financial and logistic risks due to fragmented information sources. Our platform aims to bridge this gap, making international trade simpler, safer, and more data-driven.

Objectives

Product & Country Analysis:
Allow users to input a product name and target country to retrieve demand insights and relevant trade opportunities.

Document Guidance:
Generate a dynamic checklist of export documents required for the selected product and country, including IEC, Proforma Invoice, Packing List, COO, etc.

Risk Assessment:
Provide visual risk indicators (high, medium, low) for payment, logistics, and regulatory challenges for each product-country combination.

Data-Driven Suggestions:
Offer actionable recommendations for optimizing the export process, including market tips and compliance advice.

Professional & Interactive UI:
Ensure a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface for quick access to insights, graphs, and export guidance.
